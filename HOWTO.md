WELCOME TO WATCH PARTY!
Watch Party was made using a Rails backend and a React front end. If you do not have those, you will want to download and install before proceeding. 

To get started using this app you will need to start your backend server first before the front end. To do this 

* cd into the watch-backend folder. 
* run 'bundle install'
* run 'rails db:seed'
* run 'rails s'

After the backend has been started proceed to start the front end. 

* cd into watchparty-frontend
* run 'npm install'
* run 'npm start'
* when prompted to run on another port say yes and the app will open in your browser.
